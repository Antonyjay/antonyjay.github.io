I created a blog application that allows users to do the following:
- register an account
- login
- logout

Once logged in, a user should be able to:
- create a post
- view a list of their own posts
- view a list of everyone's posts
- view a specific post, including the comments people have made about it
- leave a comment on a post

I also added an encryption to my blog application so that your user's passwords are stored safely.

For this blog I used the js libraries:
bcrypt
body-parser
express
express-session
pg
pug
sequelize
sass
